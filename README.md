# BHCexam

[中文版](./README-zh.md)

BHCexam is an exam class designed for mathematics teacher in China.

Now it is used by [mathcrowd.cn](www.mathcrowd.cn) ( an opensource math exam database) as the default class to export exam papers in pdf.

Using bhcexam you can

* separate the format and the content very well;
* export both teacher paper and student paper;
* typeset multiple choice questions with 3-6 options keeping adaptively neat alignment;
* typeset cloze questions with an adaptively underline;
* typeset questions with subquestions in list;
* group questions  in list to control whether to show score, leave spacing, initialize question number;
* and more (see [BHCexam Documentation](http://docs.mathcrowd.cn/advances/bhcexam.html)).
