### bhcexam
The BHCexam document class attempts to make it easy for even a LaTeX novice to prepare exams.

#### Notice

The BHCexam document class is no longer designed for typesetting math papers by .tex manully after version 0.4. Instead the author started a community  called Mathcrowd for math teachers to share their math exams in a public database. Members can prepare their math exams on the web.

#### Release

v0.4 is a stable version with documentation [download](https://github.com/mathedu4all/bhcexam/releases/download/v0.4/bhcexam.zip).
